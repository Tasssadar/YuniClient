YuniClientMobile 1.0 "Ice-planet" (15 march 2011)

    YuniClientMobile 1.0 - Implements features expected from mobile client
    with just basic UI.

    ==== Features ====

    * Connects to bluetooth module on robot via bluetooth
    * Can flash program into robot if robot has avakar's bootloader
    * Can send characters to robot
    * Can show output from robot
    * Can control robot's movement if implemented in its program via three protocols:
        * Keyboard - just sends chars WASD as on keyboars
        * YuniRC - sends WASD chars plus "d" or "u" depending on press or release of key
        * Packets - send packets in my own protocol format
    * Can use accelerometer or ball ui for controling robot
    * Can edit EEPROM memory in robot if implemented in its program
    * Can save and load EEPROM content from data files
    
    ==== Supported microcontrollers ====
    
    * ATmega16
    * ATmega32
    * ATmega48
    * ATmega88
    * ATmega128 (only 16-bit addresses available)
